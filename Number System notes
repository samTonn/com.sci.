to convert decimal to binary, you devide the number my 2, and the remainder will be either 0 or 1. thats the right most digit.
then devide by two again and repeat until your division outputs 0 (aka impossible to do 1/2, but has a remainder of 1).

to convert from binary to decimal, you take the right most digit and multiply by 2^0, and write that somewhere. the second digit is multplied by 2^1, and then the next 2^2, etc.
then you take all those values and add them up, and that's your number.

here's the code for each:

# Binary to decimal conversion
def binary_to_decimal(binary):
    decimal = 0
    power = len(binary) - 1
    for digit in binary:
        decimal += int(digit) * 2 ** power
        power -= 1
    return decimal

# Decimal to binary conversion
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = ""
    while decimal > 0:
        binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary
        decimal //= 2
    return binary

# Examples
binary_num = "10101"
decimal_num = 21
print(binary_to_decimal(binary_num))   # Output: 21
print(decimal_to_binary(decimal_num))  # Output: 10101
